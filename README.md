## Hello! I'm Nikhil :D
<p>I spend most of my time building what interests me – from Agentic workflow development to modding my guitar, building a NAS, or even a http server from scratch, etc. I love exploring new tech and building things.</p>
<p> Currently I'm working to build AI personal smart glasses, **Petal**.</p>
